# 📘 About This Project

This project is developed as part of Caption Project  to predict and understand **extreme weather events** in **Nepal**.

## 🎯 Objective
To build a machine learning-based pipeline that:
- Predicts daily climate variables for each district in Nepal
- Classifies upcoming days into **normal or extreme weather events**
- Identifies **event types** like flood, drought, heatwave, and coldwave

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Streamlit** for the interactive web app
- **scikit-learn** for regression and classification models
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data processing
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualizations
- **Cimate data** from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saimondahal/nepal-daily-climate-1981-2019?resource=download
- **Shape file**
